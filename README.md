## About the project
This is the first game that I produced and released. It was made for me to learn to work with PHP (it is also my first application with the language), to develop my skills with javascript and to improve my techniques of pixel art and sprite sheets.

#### Technical Information
No special framework or package was used to make the game, only the native languages ​​javascript, PHP, HTML and a little bit of CSS.

All of the game's sprites and images were adapted from community resources or created by me. 
Music and sound effects are from a community repository.

#### Notes
Sorry for the badly formatted CSS design, that was not the focus of the project.
